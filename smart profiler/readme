INTRODUCTION
The Smart Profiler is a pattern created as part of the Viento project. It's goal is to tune apps to the needs of individuals living in various parts of Latin America whom are often using cheap Android phones with limited data plans.


SMART PROFILER OBJECTIVES
To smartly conserve battery, network and storage to create lighter, less consuming apps.
To make apps more efficient and personalized in their behavior.


PREMISE: ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL
People have different needs. There’s no one default. The smart profiler provides a flexible system to know the individual and to tune the app foreground and background activities to their needs, rather than having a one-size fits all solution for settings.


THE DEFAULT: OPTIMIZED OR EVERYTHING MODE
The default setting primarily has to deal with how the network is used. Battery settings are the same for all modes. Storage settings are handled separately depending on the state of the user's available storage on the device and SD card.

- If poor network (2G, 3G or none) and/or on a low-end phone (screen resolution below 720), then assume the user has a  limited or slow data experience. Set the mode to 'Optimized'. Provide an easy way to use data in special cases as determined by the user. For example, offer the option to set certain sources as priority and provide a shortcut to use data for a given set of time.

- If the network is good (4G) and the phone quality is decent (720 resolution or higher), then set the default mode to 'Everything'.


FURTHER CUSTOMIZATIONS
- Storage: If internal storage is low or certain app features are likely to take up a lot of space, then offer the option to put things on the SD card instead. If the user does not have an SD card, set the default for what is kept to be minimal.
** UI example

- When data starts to run out: If x% of data has been used in the month at a given time, switch to wifi only. For example — Half way through through the month, 50% of data should have been used. If data use has exceeded that to 70%, then offer to switch to wifi only if the user's settings are set to use data.
** UI example if the user has used more data than usual for a given time

- Battery: If the phone is low-end, then the app should be proactive about preserving battery, we can automatically schedule battery-intensive or low-priority tasks to occur only when the phone is plugged in.

FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE CUSTOMIZED DEFAULT
- Network (2G, 3G, 4G, none or wifi): This info helps us learn about which type of network the user is typically using, and helps us make an assumption about the quality of their data plan.

- Data Available: We can tell how much data has been used per the user's normal usage history.

- Storage: Determine amount currently available and if there is an SD card

- Phone Quality: Determined by screen resolution and memory

- Battery: We can use the Android scheduler API to schedule tasks to only happen when plugged in.

HOW THE SMART PROFILER APPLIES TO OUR 3 APPS

OPEN ARCHIVE
Use case #1: Uploading on the go
As a journalist using my phone to conduct investigations, I want to upload pictures, videos, and interviews while I’m traveling from one place to another, so my team will be able to see them immediately.

Affects: Network
User needs:
* Want to upload quickly
* Want to upload over potentially bad networks
* Need to preserve phone battery

Experience:
Optimized mode: 
* Wifi only — *In the UI, give the user the option to use data
* No compression

Everything mode:
* Wifi and data
* No compression

Further:
* If poor battery, only upload when plugged in
* Sleep if battery is below 15%
* If an upload gets stuck or is taking too long, give the option to upload when connected to wifi or to compress
* If the user is exceeding the normal amount of data used, prompt to switch them to wifi

Use case #2: 
As a journalist with sensitive data, I want to off load pictures from my phone as soon as possible.

Affects: Storage and network
May need to compress some media.


F-DROID
Use case #1: I want to get 5 apps from a person near me, but have limited storage space on my phone.

User Needs
* Easily connect to a nearby device offline to get specific apps
* Minimize the storage space required to get the apps

Experience
Default:
* Choose to sync F-Droid repo? Or give the option to opt out of getting the F-Droid repo or make and F-Droid Nearby only app

Optimized mode:
* Wifi only
* Screenshots are compressed to a standard size
* Only auto-sync screenshots for apps that are new or recently updated
* Show previews (or the option to manually fetch) screenshots for all other apps

Everything mode:
* Wifi and data
* Show screenshots for all apps

Further: 
* If SD card is available, move FD to SD card; Move any apps that can be on the SD card to SD card if downloaded from FD
* Schedule app updates 


COURIER
Use case #1: As a user on limited bandwidth and a poor phone, I want to get the latest important stories as soon as I can.

Experience:
Optimized mode:
* Wifi only for full media
* Data for text only
* Expire after reading, unless book marked

Everything mode:
* Wifi and data
* Expire after 1 day unless book marked

Customizations:
* Choose to get previews over wifi if you don’t want everything auto-downloaded
* Choose to get previews over data if you want more visual excitement without using a lot of data

Further:
* Wait to sync if battery is below 25%
* If the user is exceeding the normal amount of data used, prompt to switch them to wifi
